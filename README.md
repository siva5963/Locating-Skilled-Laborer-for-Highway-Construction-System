Highway construction and engineering includes planning, designing, and building of highways. History stands witness that good roads lead to prosperity for distant societies. If a road is well planned and then executed according to the plan, a highway can open the gates of growth and development. Highways connect two or more places and ensure that industries, employment, and development follow. Bridges, traffic lights, pavements, bike paths, and lane dividers make up a safe highway.
